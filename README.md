## About The Project

My first attempt at trying to maintain a repo for #hacktoberfest (YAY!)
Your stars help this repo qualify for syndication libraries. Please star BEFORE you are merged!
Please give me 24 hours to respond to issues or pull requests. 😎

This project is a simple website with a theme switcher and page switcher in Javascript. You can drop the theme switcher and/or page switcher into your project and it's highly customizable.
* Flat file list of themes located in a theme folder so you can make multiple css files for your site!
* Flat file list of pages located in a pages folder so you can make webpages, presentation slides, activities, etc.
* Magically ✨🧙‍♂️✨ switch your fancy theme to an <a href="https://venngage.com/blog/accessible-colors/">Accessible Color Scheme</a> or Darkmode 🐱‍👤

🤩

☝ Although this project is intended to be beginner friendly 💗, it should not be easy 🚫. Because some people might be really advanced at C++ or Python but never made a webpage before, I'm trusting that people don't use this repository for an easy pull request. **Tiny PRs won't be merged such as typos, spaces, spam** without a significant contribution. Please stretch your limits 🤓 and challenge yourself 💪🏽.

For total beginners, I will be listing ongoing issues and enhancement ideas that you can partake in. If you have an idea or suggestion, feel free to raise an issue or start a  [Discussions](https://github.com/omicreativedev/hacktoberfest2023/discussions). This site is very basic, and I made it after taking a few lessons on freeCodeCamp. 💖💖💖 Anyone can do it!
