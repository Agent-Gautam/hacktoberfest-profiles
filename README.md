This project is a free website template (CC0-OpenSource) with theme switcher and page switcher written in Javascript. You can drop the theme switcher and/or page switcher into your project. Or you can download the website as a free template and use it to get started. This is perfect for those who just started learning HTML/CSS and JS.

### Features
* Flat file list of themes located in a theme folder so you can make multiple css files for your site!
* Flat file list of pages located in a pages folder so you can make webpages, presentation slides, activities, etc.
* Magically ✨🧙‍♂️✨ switch your fancy theme to an <a href="https://venngage.com/blog/accessible-colors/">Accessible Color Scheme</a> or Darkmode 🐱‍👤

For Hacktoberfest, I will be listing ongoing issues and enhancement ideas for friends, family, fellow students and other first timers to participate in and get a feel for Opensource, using Git, and basic scripting. I'll also list some issues that are no-code, low-code, documentation, and ux/gfx. Here you have a safe place you can learn and make mistakes and it's okay! If you have an idea or suggestion, feel free to raise an issue or start a  [Discussions](https://github.com/omicreativedev/hacktoberfest2023/discussions). This site is very basic, and I made it after taking lessons on freeCodeCamp. 💖💖💖 Anyone can do it!
