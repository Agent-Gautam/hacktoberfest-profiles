Create A New Profile Page in Pages Folder

- Copy the omicreativedev.html and rename it yourpagename.html
- yourpagename.html should be in the same folder as omicreativedev.html
- Edit the contents of yourpagename.html
- Don't forget to update your profile picture, the meta data, the og:image, etc.
- Don't remove the javascript or the link back to home
- Your page MUST use the themeswitcher and look good with all themes.
- You can add custom CSS to the <HEAD></HEAD> of yourpagename.html
- TEST ALL YOUR CODE LOCALLY and make SURE it is SAFE and that nothing breaks BEFORE making a PR.
- YES, if you know how, you can add custom Javascript. It MUST be safe!
- DO NOT ALTER any theme files in such a way that they break other pages (including index.)
- If your page needs images, you can add them in pages/img/yourpagename/
- If your make an external JS file for just your page, put it in pages/js/yourpagename/
- If you have an image or js file that ANYONE can use, put it in pages/img/ or pages/js/ respectively.
- Do not change the index, other pages, or theme files when adding pages.
- When you create a page, you must update pages_list.txt

- Edit the theme so that it is 100% unique but don't delete or change existing classes (adding ok)
- Add your name in a comment and link to your github and/or twitter to the top of the theme
- TEST ALL YOUR CODE LOCALLY and make SURE it is SAFE and that nothing breaks BEFORE requesting to merge.
- WE ARE NOT converting to LESS or SCSS for the purpose of this being beginner friendly.

  #### SOME THEME IDEAS
  - A Halloween Theme

## OTHER Ways To Contribute

- Fix an Issue
- Suggest an Enhancement (don't suggest what you will not create)

## WHAT NOT TO DO

- Do not forget to keep your branch updated and resolve any problems before making a pull request.
- Do not stray too far from the path! I don't have the capacity to deal with a lot of branch conflicts. Please stay within the the scope of creating pages and themes. Themes should work on all pages. Nothing should break. Everything should be in neat folders where it belongs so nothing becomes too messy.
- Do not spam. This includes making PRs for small typos, fixing white space, etc. [Here are some examples of bad practices](https://twitter.com/shitoberfest). If it is a small change, just bring it up in a discussion or raise an issue.
